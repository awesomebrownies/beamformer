# June 18: Phased Array Research

This project has been in the works in my head for some time now, and I am ready to log progress. I'll be making sketches of my ideas, theorizing solutions to problems, and creating software for my needs.

The overall idea of the project is to use algorithms to digitally compare two synchronized RX timelines and use the difference in phase to determine direction. I'll be focusing that down to targeting user devices such as phones. I'll need to create programs to identify target frequencies, and isolate devices to further gather information (Like determining if it's a phone or a laptop).

Total Time: **1 hour**

# June 24: Design Sketches

My original design was to use a gear system for changing the length, but I find it too limiting. I had also thought of creating multiple slotting rods that can be stored with a velcro strap. However, I eventually have settled on a telescoping rod design. It will have a locking mechanism that must be twisted against the force of a spring to move. I plan on having three rods that use this to telescope. Below is a sketch I created.

Total Time: **1 hour 30 minutes**
