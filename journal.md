# June 18: Phased Array

This project has been in the works in my head for some time now, and I am ready to log progress. I'll be making sketches of my ideas, theorizing solutions to problems, and creating software for my needs.

The overall idea of the project is to use algorithms to digitally compare two synchronized RX timelines and use the difference in phase to determine direction. I'll be focusing that down to targeting user devices such as phones. I'll need to create programs to identify target frequencies, and isolate devices to further gather information (Like determining if it's a phone or a laptop).

Total Time: **1 hour**
